    <h1>Andriod OS</h1>
    <h3>The default UI of Android relies on direct manipulation inputs such as tapping, swiping and pinching to initiate actions. The device provides haptic feedback to the user via alerts such as vibrations to respond to actions. If a user presses a navigation button, for example, the device vibrates.

        When a user boots a device, Android OS displays the home screen, which is the primary navigation hub for Android devices and is comprised of widgets and app icons. Widgets are informational displays that automatically update content such as weather or news. The home screen display can differ based on the device manufacturer that is running the OS. Users can also choose different themes for the home screen via third-party apps on Google Play.</h3>
