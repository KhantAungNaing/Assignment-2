 <h1>Window OS</h1>
 <h3>Windows is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families developed and marketed by Microsoft. Each family caters to a certain sector of the computing industry. Active Windows families include Windows NT and Windows IoT; these may encompass subfamilies (e.g. Windows Server or Windows Embedded Compact/Windows CE). Defunct Windows families include Windows 9x, Windows Mobile and Windows Phone.

    Microsoft introduced an operating environment named Windows on November 20, 1985, as a graphical operating system shell for MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces (GUIs).[6]</h3>
